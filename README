ElmahMod readme

This is a fork of Elmah (http://code.google.com/p/elmah/) to include some additional functionality:
 * To (recursively) log inner exceptions.
 * To log Exception.Data (should handle IDictionary, IEnumerable)
 * Additional trace message can be added.
 
 Right now the library compiled to .NET 3.5, but works in .NET 4.0 as well. The solution itself is created using C# 2010 Express...
